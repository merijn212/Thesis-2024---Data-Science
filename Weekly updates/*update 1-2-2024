# Recap:
1. I looked into possible literature to support my thesis design
2. I tried to find the research gap but at the moment but I am not quite there yet
3. I have found a few databases that have a large number of epubs (example: www.epubbooks.com) 

# To do:
1. Make a first version of my thesis design (includes finding the right literature)

# Questions/comments:
1. I would like to further discuss the project so I fully know the context and what is expected from me in the next months
